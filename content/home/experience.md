        Responsibilities include:
        
        * The core member in the project ``online video restoration and enhancement system" is responsible for investigating deep spatial-temporal models (i.e., RNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc.) for real-time video processing.
        * Proposed a novel knowledge transfer method based on the optimal transport theory. The performance of the lightweight models can be improved by 0.15 dB without increasing model complexity. The proposed method can significantly accelerate the running speed by 400%.
