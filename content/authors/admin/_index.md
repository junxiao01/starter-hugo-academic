I am currently a postdoc fellow in the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I received my PhD and MSc degree (with distinction) (supervised by Prof. Kenneth K. M. Lam) from the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Before coming to the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, I obtained my BSc degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, supervised by Prof. Wing-Kuen Ling, in 2016.

My research interests include machine learning (Bayesian and robust machine learning), image/video restoration and quality enhancement, and financial time series analysis.
