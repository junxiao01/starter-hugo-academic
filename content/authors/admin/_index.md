I am currently a postdoc fellow, supervised by [Prof. Kin-Man Lam](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~enkmlam/), in the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

My research interests include image/video processing, restoration and enhancement (e.g., image/video super-resolution, image/video denoising, high dynamic range imaging, etc.), machine learning (e.g., bayesian machine learning, domain adaptation and generalization, robustness, etc.), deep generative models (e.g., diffusion models and flow matching), and AIGC-related topics.
